Challenge 1  In this Module, you will continue with your “Book Connect” codebase, and further iterate on your abstractions. You must create an encapsulated abstraction of the book preview using a single factory function. If you are up for it, you can also encapsulate other aspects of the app into their own abstractions.\\n \\nIf you are up for it, you can also convert other aspects of the app into web components.\\n \\nYou will have a call with your coach where you highlight the following:\\n\\nWhat problems did you encounter converting the book preview to a component?\\nWhat other elements make sense to convert into web components? Why?\\nWhy does keeping your HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a single file sometimes make sense?\\n\\n \\nIn your 1-on-1 session with your coach, you must demonstrate your understanding of all concepts covered in this module. It is at the coach's discretion to determine what they will ask you, and how deeply they require you to understand specific concepts.\\n   \\n      \\n      Previous Lesson  \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",

[DWA_07.1 Creating Abstraction with SOLID  As we learned in the previous module, abstraction is an important principle of software design that allows developers to create more flexible, maintainable, and reusable code. In this module, we will cover what exactly makes a good abstraction, specifically by introducing some common guidelines, and three different paradigms that have their own opinion on how abstraction should be done in software. In JavaScript, abstraction can be implemented using the SOLID principles, which are a set of guidelines for object-oriented programming.\\n \\nLet's do a quick overview of how to implement abstraction in JavaScript with SOLID, before diving into the first lecture, 'Creating Abstraction with SOLID'.\\n\\n\\nSingle Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that a class or module should have only one reason to change. To apply SRP in JavaScript, you can create separate modules or classes that handle specific tasks or responsibilities. Each module or class should be responsible for a single functionality or feature, and should not be coupled with other functionalities.\\n\\n\\nOpen-Closed Principle (OCP): This principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In JavaScript, you can apply this principle by creating abstract classes or interfaces that define a set of methods or properties. Concrete classes can then inherit from these abstract classes or interfaces and implement their methods. This way, you can add new functionalities without modifying existing code.\\n\\n\\nLiskov Substitution Principle (LSP): This principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In JavaScript, you can implement LSP by ensuring that subclasses inherit all the properties and methods of their superclass, and do not alter their behaviour in unexpected ways.\\n\\n\\nInterface Segregation Principle (ISP): This principle states that a client should not be forced to depend on methods it does not use. In JavaScript, you can apply ISP by creating small, focused interfaces that define only the methods that a client needs. This way, you can avoid creating large, bloated interfaces that are difficult to maintain and understand.\\n\\n\\nDependency Inversion Principle (DIP): This principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Instead, both should depend on abstractions. In JavaScript, you can implement DIP by using dependency injection, which allows you to pass dependencies to a module or class rather than creating them inside. This way, you can decouple modules and make them more reusable and testable.\\n\\n\\n \\nNow, let's learn how you can implement abstraction in JavaScript and create more maintainable, flexible, and reusable code by following SOLID principles. The code used in this video is available in the following GitHub repository.\\n \\n\\n \\n00:00:00 Introduction\\n00:01:00 Ignoring \"Classes\" for now\\n00:02:00 Revisiting the Todo App\\n00:02:30 Provided HTML and CSS\\n00:03:00 What is \"Procedural Programming\"?\\n00:03:40 Treating functions as instructions\\n00:04:10 Commenting out dynamic HTML\\n00:05:00 Creating task HTML with JavaScript\\n00:05:30 Real example of error/type-checking\\n00:07:40 Creating element and setting \"innerHTML\"\\n00:08:10 Error/type-checking catches the hidden bug\\n00:09:10 Creating the first abstraction with function\\n00:10:20 Introducing the \"SOLID\" acronym as principles\\n00:11:00 Important not to treat ideas as dogma\\n00:12:10 \"S\" stands for \"Single Responsibility\"\\n00:13:20 Splitting responsibilities between abstractions\\n00:14:20 Configuring function to create a task\\n00:17:00 Creating a function to update a task\\n00:17:30 How to export type definitions\\n00:18:00 \"Pick\" and \"Omit\" type helpers\\n00:20:00 \"Partial\" and \"Required\" type helpers\\n00:21:20 When to throw unhandled errors\\n00:22:10 Knowing when to abstract behaviour\\n00:22:40 Creating \"getHtml\" helper function\\n00:24:40 Good abstractions prevent low-level bugs\\n00:26:10 Duplication isn't always bad\\n00:27:40 \"D\" stand for \"Dependency Inversion\"\\n00:28:40 Thinking outside inwards vs inside outwards\\n00:30:00 Remember that goal is a composition\\n \\n \\n Further reading To further unpack the concepts covered in this module, please work through the following resources:\\n \\n          - WATCH: Object Oriented vs Functional Programming with TypeScript by Fireship\\n          - WATCH: Functional, Procedural & Object-oriented Programming - An Overview by Academind\\n \\n   \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",

Concluding the above, it is clear that what most people call JavaScript is technically titled ECMAScript. However, as quantum physicists don't preface all mentions of time with the relevant space-time in question, we will continue with the popular naming convention of \"JavaScript\".\\n \\nHowever, despite this, we need further qualifications for what we refer to when discussing JavaScript. Since what is known as JavaScript today is no longer confined to the browser. Today JavaScript is used in various applications, from NASA spacesuits to creating hybrid mobile applications (as covered in this course). However, for the sake of this course, we will consider JavaScript as a language similar to English. In short, a way to describe a set of instructions and what is done with these instructions is inconsequential.\\n \\nFollowing this metaphor, we can see the JavaScript spec as a dictionary indicating the syntax, words, and structure to be assumed when writing or reading the instructions. Similar to dictionaries, there is not a single \"correct\" dictionary, but several editions published at different times.\\n \\nFurthermore, this dictionary metaphor works exceptionally well for JavaScript since, while the language changes over time, there is no definitive point where specifications (dictionary rules) are implemented wholesale. Instead, the language itself fluxes and shifts on a smooth continuum. Yet, while the specification updates, it is adopted continually (for example, there is no clear point where English speakers switched from Shakespearian Old English to Victorian-era English or even Modern English).\\n \\nTo further complicate this, there are also different ways the language is used in other circumstances. Yet all of them are covered in the specification and are still considered JavaScript (none are considered more \"real\" versions of JavaScript than the others). A fitting example would be the distinction between business jargon, everyday conversation and academic English. Yet none of these is a more \"real\" manifestation of English than the others.\\n \\nNo wonder many developers colloquially refer to the mental impact that working with JavaScript has on developers as JavaScript Fatigue. Of course, it would be nice to have JavaScript be similar to stable runtime environments like PHP, Ruby or Python, where you know the exact syntax, functionality and limitation of how a compiler will execute your code. Yet, despite this back-to-front logic, JavaScript seems to be near-ubiquitous in the software world.\\n \\nThe reason for the dramatic surge of JavaScript is a contentious topic, and it is clear that there are numerous factors. However, one possible factor is the development and specification process outlined above. To quote Dmitri Grabov in an article titled Why JavaScript is eating the World:\\n \\nThe enterprise grade solutions which power all large companies were never designed to be easy to customise. Software was viewed much like a nuclear power plant. You build it and then it sits there doing its job. It will need maintenance and eventual decommissioning, but until then it functions as a unit. Those enterprise grade solutions were similarly designed as a unit. Sadly, this approach to software development is not even remotely viable today.\\n— Dmitri Grabov, Why JavaScript is eating the World (2018)\\n \\nIn short, in an ironic twist of fate, the very upside-down and make-shift process of standardising JavaScript has turned a simple scripting language with so many imperfections into one of the most widely-used languages. The fact that there will never be a new JavaScript 2 (but instead an unbroken continuing of \"JavaScript\" with incremental changes) makes this language so powerful.\\n \\nES6 and further iterations of JavaScript are often incorrectly viewed as augmented versions of JavaScript, whereas ES5 is subsequently seen as the \"real\" version. There are several reasons for this, and they are understandable. However, as you'll probably guess from the content covered in the previous lesson, this view needs to be revised. Furthermore, by treating versions of JavaScript as equivalencies to, for example, PHP, Ruby or Python versions, we need to include more of what makes this little language so powerful.\\n \\n \\n   \\n      \\n      Previous Lesson  \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",
      "8   [DWA_06.5 Challenge 1  This exercise presents you with a working version of the “Book Connect” website you previously audited as your final challenge. However, you must use objects and functions as abstractions to make the code more maintainable, extendable and easier to change.\\n \\nYou might have already done this in your audit, but this is an opportunity to revisit your decisions and perhaps adjust, change, remove or add abstractions to improve the codebase. Also, please remember that you are encouraged to consider higher-level concepts discussed in the previous lessons, such as documentation, Styleguides and abstractions. Finally, you can start from scratch with the initially provided repository, merely using the script.js file below as a replacement or continue working on your version (if you created one) and updating the data.js file as listed below.\\n \\nAs always, it is essential to note that you will be required to talk about the “how” and “why” you made specific decisions and not just present the “what” of the decisions that you made.\\n \\nNote that the code below (unlike the previous code you were provided with up until this point) does precisely what you need it to do; you need to rewrite (using abstraction and all the techniques you’ve learned up until now) to make it easier to maintain, change and understand.\\n \\n// Ensure that the data.js file exports all it's values.

software, we must have a solid understanding of the nuances of the JavaScript language itself.\\n \\nYou may be surprised to discover how distinct JavaScript is from other programming languages. Understanding these differences between JavaScript and more “traditional” programming languages is critical since JavaScript constitutes the low-level material we will use to create our software during this course. In the same way, an architect must understand the fundamental properties of steel, glass, concrete and wood; you must understand the nature of JavaScript inside-out.\\n \\nIn a certain sense, this module is the inverse of the preceding “Managing Complexity” module since it contains no video content. However, you are required to work through the range of supplied reading material. Similar to the previous module, your understanding of the programming concepts and subject matter will be tested during your 1-on-1 session with your coach on the key concepts in this module.\\n \\nIntroduction\\n \\nYou might have heard someone refer to a specific version of JavaScript as ES5, ES6, ES7 or even by a suffixed date (for example, ES2015). You might even have used a particular version of JavaScript or even know the differences between different versions - yet you might not understand what the \"ES\" abbreviation refers to or why there are even different versions.\\n \\nThe Web vs The Internet\\n \\nBefore we get to JavaScript specifically, expanding our scope to include the Web is beneficial. A high-level understanding of how we came to where we are today will help demystify many concepts discussed later in this module.\\n \\nFirst and foremost, it is essential to distinguish between what is known as the \"Web\" and the \"Internet\". Both of these are often used interchangeably. However, the Internet refers to the underlying hardware and infrastructure on which the Web is built. Furthermore, the Web is only one of several ecosystems built on top of the Internet. The Internet is also used by various other platforms like IMAP/SMTP (for email) and a range of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The Internet itself precedes the Web by several years. The Internet initially started as ARPANET, developed exclusively for military use by the United States government.\\n \\nLanguage of the Web\\n \\nToday, the Web, or more technically correct, the \"World Wide Web\" (hence the WWW abbreviation), is primarily accredited to a single individual: Tim Berners-Lee.\\nWhile working as a physicist for the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland, Berners-Lee developed the concept of an extensive decentralised collection of documents described by a single, unified markup language. This markup language eventually became known as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), and the network itself, while initially called the \"Information Mesh\" and at a later point \"Mine of Information\", eventually became the \"World Wide Web\". The language and tools required to host a server on the Web were released for free and as open-source by Berner's Lee. By 1993 there were about 500 servers connected to the Web. These servers contained various documents styled in the HTML language as follows:\\n \\n<TABLE BGCOLOR=\"#CCCCFF\" BORDER=\"10\" ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\n  <TR>\\n    <TD>\\n      <H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\\n        <FONT SIZE=\"3\" COLOR=\"red\" FACE=\"arial\">\\n          Welcome to the World Wide Web!\\n        </FONT>\\n      </H1>\\n    </TD>\\n  </TR>\\n</TABLE>\\n \\nNoted, this is quite a far cry from what we know today as HTML. Perhaps the most striking is the common usage of all-uppercase tags in the early days of the Web (as also seen in the HTML 4 specification). Only with the formulation of XHTML in 2000 did writing lowercase become the dominant convention (since XML, upon which it was built, requires tags to be lowercase). Similarly striking in the above example is the application of styling using HTML tags and attributes like <FONT>. While the notion of a dedicated styling language, eventually called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), was several years away, a quest for a scripting language was burning hot. At this point, HTML was exclusively a static language. This means that it cannot be changed after loading the page.\\n \\n \\n    \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",

                   [DWA_02.4 The JavaScript Specification  Two years before the founding of the Web Standards Project, Netscape caught wind of this growing frustration and, upon seeing its diminishing market share against Internet Explorer, approached the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) to create a standardised specification that could be used by Netscape's JavaScript and all its variants.\\n \\nIf you're not familiar with the concept of a specification, and specifically a \"requirement specification\", it is described by Wikipedia as follows:\\n \\nA requirement specification is a documented requirement or set of documented requirements, to be satisfied by a given material, design, product, service, etc. It is a common early part of engineering design and product development processes, in many fields.\\n— Wikipedia, Specification (technical standard)\\n \\nThe specification is a collection of documents describing how JavaScript and its variants should work in the context of JavaScript and its variants. For example, here is an extract from the very first specification created by ECMA explaining how single-line commenting should work:\\n \\nBecause a single-line comment can contain any character except a \"LineTerminator\" character, and because of the general rule that a token is always as long as possible, a single-line comment always consists of all characters from the \"//\" marker to the end of the line. However, the \"LineTerminator\" at the end of the line is not considered to be part of the single-line comment; it is recognized separately by the lexical grammar and becomes part of the stream of input elements for the syntactic grammar. This point is very important because it implies that the presence or absence of single-line comments does not affect the process of automatic semicolon insertion (see section 7.8.2).\\n— ECMA 262: 1st Edition (1997)\\n \\nIn short:\\n\\nThe compiler should not execute single-line comments.\\nSinge-line comments should always start with \"//\"\\nSingle-line comments accept any character except line breaks.\\nSingle-line comments end before the first line breaks\\n\\n \\nThis means that all JavaScript compilers should honour the following:\\n \\n// console.log('This code should be executed')\\n\\nconsole.log('This code should be executed')\\n \\nYou can think of the original HTML specification created by Berners-Lee insofar that it was an open document that tells browser makers to make sure that their browser handles the HTML code in the manner specified in the document. So, for example, the HTML specification outlines that the <img> tag should be used to express an image and that browsers can't create their version called <netscape-img> or <super-image>. In the same way, the hope was that the specification created by ECMA could be used as a standard for how scripting should work in all browsers.\\n \\nEventually, ECMA submitted their proposed specification, titled \"ECMAScript: A general purpose, cross-platform programming language\". After internal negotiations, it was adopted by both Netscape and Microsoft in 1997. Henceforth, what was previously known as JavaScript and JScript were to be unified into a single standardised language titled ECMAScript. At one point, it was considered even to change the file extension from .js to .es. Yet, the name never really caught on, and to this day, we still refer to it as JavaScript - even though JavaScript technically refers to the Netscape Navigator-specific scripting language. Interestingly enough, the original creator of JavaScript, Brendan Eich, attributes this to general blandness of the name \"ECMAScript\".\\n \\n\"ECMAScript was always an unwanted trade name that sounds like a skin disease.\"\\n— Brendan Eich, Will there be a suggested file suffix for ES4? (2006)\\n \\nYet, the volunteer-driven group tasked with creating and maintaining new ECMAScript specifications was designated an even more ominous-sounding name, merely titled Technical Committee 39 (TC39). I often joke that this sounds like something from George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four novel.\\n \\nYet, despite this name, TC39 is still the primary caretaker of the ECMAScript specification used by all compilers. As a result, you can follow the development of the language in real-time on GitHub at https://github.com/tc39, and even propose unique additions or changes using issues or pull requests.\\n \\n \\n   \\n      \\n      Previous Lesson  \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",

Compilers  If you've seen the first The Matrix movie, you might be familiar with the scene where Neo (played by Keanu Reeves) visits The Oracle and encounters a boy bending a spoon by means of what appears to be psychokinesis.\\n \\nNeo, upon enquiring how it is possible, is met with the following response:\\n \\n\"Do not try and bend the spoon. That's impossible. Instead, only try to realise the Truth... There is no spoon... Then you'll see that it is not the spoon that bends; it is only yourself.\"\\n— The Matrix (1999)\\n \\nThis is a highly apt analogy for the current JavaScript ecosystem. Making sense of JavaScript in this day and age is nigh impossible at face value. This sentiment has become so ubiquitous that (as mentioned in the previous session) it is often referred to as Javascript Fatigue. However, this is mainly due to misunderstanding what JavaScript (or technically ECMAScript as discussed in the previous lesson) is and how to write it.\\n \\nCentral to this is a misconception is an expectation that (much like other languages) you know ahead of time which compiler will run your code, and not only that, but you know ahead of time the specific set-in-stone, pre-defined functionality and syntax supported by the compiler. This is similar to how developers think about other language compilers, for example, PHP 7, Python 3 or the upcoming Ruby 3. All these have specific versioned compilers you can often install and control on your server. By this logic, one would assume that we would have different compilers for ES5, ES6, ES7, etc. Instead, I've heard remarks like \"I don't think ES6 comes installed on Linux\" or \"We're using regular JavaScript, not ES7\".\\n \\nHowever, due to the decentralised nature of the web itself, there are around 39 different JavaScript compilers being used at the time of writing, each maintained by a different team. You might have even heard of them before; some most well-known ones are:\\n\\nv8\\nSpiderMonkey\\nChakra\\nTamarin\\n\\n \\nThis conception of a controlled shift from ES5 to ES6 and beyond (similar to the shift from the older PHP 6 to modern PHP 7) is perhaps due to the period between 1999 and 2015, where JavaScript remained primarily unchanged. In 16 years, JavaScript only saw the addition of the following three features:\\n\\nThe JSON native object\\n\"strict mode\" for more strict error checking\\nMinor changes to JavaScript objects.\\n\\n \\nThe reason for this is complicated, and a large part of it can be attributed to infighting amongst the TC39 committee itself. For this reason, the specification itself jumps straight from ES3 to ES5. Finally, the level of disagreement became so extreme that the ES4 specification itself had to be abandoned. Interestingly enough, to date, no ES4 specification has been published.\\n \\n \\n   \\n      \\n      Previous Lesson  \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",

At the moment it only meets two user stories (see below under “Resolved Stories”). Please ensure that it meets all user stories listed below:\\n \\nResolved Stories\\nScenario: Starting program state\\n\\nGIVEN that the submit button has not been pressed yet\\nAND the code has just loaded\\nTHEN “NO calculation performed” should be displayed at the bottom\\n\\nScenario: Dividing numbers result in a whole number\\n\\nGIVEN that the submit button is pressed\\nWHEN 20 is entered into the first input\\nAND 10 is entered into the second input\\nTHEN 2 should be displayed at the bottom\\n\\n \\nUnresolved Stories\\nScenario: Dividing numbers result in a decimal number\\n\\nGIVEN that the submit button is pressed\\nWHEN 20 is entered into the first input\\nAND 3 is entered into the second input\\nTHEN the number 6 with no decimal should be shown\\n\\n \\nScenario: Validation when values are missing\\n\\nGIVEN that the submit button is pressed\\nWHEN either or both inputs are empty\\nTHEN the divisions should not be done\\nAND the following should be displayed: “Division not performed. Both values are required in inputs. Try again”.\\n\\n \\nScenario: An invalid division should log an error in the console\\n\\nGIVEN that the submit button is pressed\\nWHEN 20 is entered into the first input\\nAND -3 is entered into the second input\\nTHEN the division should not be done\\nAND the following should be displayed: “Division not performed. Invalid number provided. Try again”.\\nAND an error should be logged in the browser console that shows the call stack\\nBUT the program should not crash entirely\\n\\n \\nScenario: Providing anything that is not a number should crash the program\\n\\nGIVEN that the submit button is pressed\\nWHEN ‘YOLO’ is entered into the first input\\nAND ‘+++’ is entered into the second input\\nTHEN the entire screen should be replaced with “Something critical went wrong.

competitor: Internet Explorer. Just to let you know, at this point, JavaScript was exclusively a proprietary scripting language and safe-guarded internally by the Netscape team. Consequently, Microsoft was forced to reverse engineer JavaScript and create their own called JScript, which they launched alongside CSS (an Internet Explorer exclusive). Despite the rapid development of the Web platform during this time, no overarching standardisation process existed. This meant that you effectively needed to write either JavaScript, JScript or both (depending on what browsers you want to support). This was further exacerbated by the additional JavaScript knock-off languages - the most well-known being ActionScript, created by Macromedia.\\n \\nThe resulting period is often referred to as The Browser Wars. In short:\\n \\n\"During these releases, it was common for web designers to display 'best viewed in Netscape' or 'best viewed in Internet Explorer logos. These images often identified a specific browser version and were commonly linked to a source from which the stated browser could be downloaded. These logos generally recognised the divergence between the standards supported by the browsers and signified which browser was used for testing the pages.\"\\n— Wikipedia, Browser Wars\\n \\nThings were further complicated by a massive surge in usage of Internet Explorer - eventually peaking at 95% of the market share. As a result, JScript has overtaken JavaScript in usage. Yet, the difference between the various flavours of JavaScript used by different browsers grew larger.\\n \\nThis could only continue until developers started demanding some over-arching standardisation amongst browsers. This culminated in 1998 with establishment of the Web Standards Project, headed by several prominent web developers. The organisation aimed to pressure browser makers to standardise their languages so that developers didn't need to maintain several versions of the same codebase.\\n \\n \\n   \\n      \\n      Previous Lesson  \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",

                    [DWA_02.2 Birth of JavaScript  In the early years, several competing pieces of software allowed users to view documents on the web; the most popular was Berners-Lee's browser, known as the WorldWideWeb browser. However, most browsers were highly technical and exclusively aimed at academics to be used to share documents on the Web. However, in 1993, the Nation Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) created a new Mosaic browser. In contrast to the preceding generation of browsers, Mosaic was primarily designed for ease of use. In the words of Gary Wolfe, in a 1994 edition of Wired Magazine:\\n \\n\"Mosaic is the celebrated graphical \"browser\" that allows users to travel through the world of electronic information using a point-and-click interface. Mosaic's charming appearance encourages users to load their own documents onto the Net, including color photos, sound bites, video clips, and hypertext \"links\" to other documents. By following the links - click, and the linked document appears - you can travel through the online world along paths of whim and intuition.\\n \\nMosaic is not the most direct way to find online information. Nor is it the most powerful. It is merely the most pleasurable way, and in the 18 months since it was released, Mosaic has incited a rush of excitement and commercial energy unprecedented in the history of the Net.\"\\n— Gary Wolfe, Wired Magazine (1994)\\n \\nMosaic quickly became the web browser of choice. However, with the widespread adoption of user experience at the forefront came a burgeoning desire to add interactivity to web pages.\\nAfter disputes around licensing, the original creators left NSCA and founded Netscape. Netscape was slated to release a follow-up to Mosaic called Netscape Navigator. From inception, this browser was envisaged to include a scripting language eventually. So in 1995, Netscape commissioned Brandon Eich to create an interactive scripting language for Netscape Navigator. This language was initially called \"Mocha\" and was meant to be modelled on a functional programming language called Scheme. It was later renamed to LiveScript and finally, at the behest of Netscape management, to JavaScript.\\n \\nThis rebranding to \"JavaScript\" was made in response to the meteoric popularity of the Java programming language. This was meant to imply some connection between JavaScript and Java - the latter having no real relationship with the former. Java was owned by a completely different organisation called Oracle. However, this change to \"JavaScript\" entailed more than just rebranding; the direction of the language itself was slated to change from its functional origins to appear closer to the object-oriented approach popularised by Java.\\n \\nUnfortunately, to this day, no one outside of the original Netscape team knows precisely what resulted in this radical shift in direction mid-project. However, many contemporary developers speculate that this single reorientation is to blame for all the inconsistencies and design flaws in the JavaScript language. To date, JavaScript is infamous for being extraordinarily inconsistent and confusing in design. Pulling one's nose up at JavaScript has become a favourite pastime of many developers, including JavaScript developers. An open-source repository, WTF JS, catalogues these strange, unexpected JavaScript rules and behaviours.\\n \\n \\n   \\n      \\n      Previous Lesson  \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",

In this lesson, we will reflect on how we have used polymorphism until now and introduce a new type of polymorphism, called “parametric polymorphism”, as an additional tool when creating abstractions.\\n \\n\\n \\n00:00:00 Introduction\\n00:01:00 What are Polyfills?\\n00:03:00 Example of \"padStart\" polyfill\\n00:04:00 Brief mention of \"polyfill.io\"\\n00:04:30 Dont confuse \"Poyfills\" and \"Polymorphism\"\\n00:05:10 Polymorphism means \"many forms\"\\n00:06:30 Polymorphism helps manage complexity\\n00:07:00 Recapping concept of \"encapsulation\"\\n00:07:30 Idea of \"Big Ball of Mud\"\\n00:08:00 What is \"Spaghetti Code\"?\\n00:09:50 Examples of \"encapsulation\"\\n00:10:30 Value in having re-usable components\\n00:11:20 Components will grow indefinitely\\n00:12:10 Aim for a few reusable components\\n00:13:00 You Need to learn to evaluate yourself\\n00:13:50 Example #1: Subtype Polymorphism\\n00:14:20 Example #2: Structural Polymorphism\\n00:16:10 Example #3: Ad-hoc Polymorphism\\n00:17:10 Example #4 Coercion Polymorphism\\n00:19:10 What is \"over-abstraction\"?\\n00:20:10 Examples of abstraction in design\\n00:22:00 Abstraction in the World of Art\\n00:25:50 Example of \"over-abstraction\" in art\\n00:26:30 \"Over-abstraction\" in visual design\\n00:27:20 Abstracting too much can be harmful\\n00:28:40 \"design patterns as Idea\" vs \"Design Patterns\"\\n00:29:20 Attempt to create abstract, general solutions\\n00:29:50 \"Design Patterns\" conceived before JavaScript\\n00:30:20 Programming changed considerably since\\n00:31:10 \"Design Patterns\" possible \"over-abstraction\"\\n00:32:10 Still valuable learning \"Design Patterns\"\\n00:33:10 Some warnings about \"Design Patterns\"\\n00:35:10 Encouraged to read about \"Design Patterns\\n00:36:00 Dont blindly follow \"Design Patterns\" solutions\\n00:36:20 Example of using the \"Singleton\" pattern\\n00:39:00 Why is \"Singleton\" bad in JavaScript?\\n00:41:40 What are \"idioms\" and \"idiomatic\"\\n00:42:10 Example of \"idioms\" in human language\\n00:43:20 Some developers aware not aware of this\\n00:44:40 Adding missing \"static\" to class\\n00:45:20 Careful of universal, silver-bullet answers\\n00:46:00 Important to start evaluating yourself\\n \\n \\n \\n Further reading Please explore the following resources to understand better the concepts covered in this module.\\n \\n          - READ: The Wrong Abstraction by Sandi Metz\\n          - READ: MDN: Using templates and slots\\n          - READ: Shadow DOM slots, composition\\n          - READ: Shoelace: A forward-thinking library of web components\\n          - WATCH: AHA Programming - Kent C.

through the first 3 modules of this course, it's time to practice.\\n \\nTo complete this module, please navigate to the freeCodeCamp ES6 course and complete all of the exercises up to and including “Import a Default Export”.  PLEASE NOTE: You are required to complete all the exercises in preparation for your next 1-on-1 code review session with your coach.\\n \\nECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript. Because all major browsers follow this specification, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable.\\n \\nMost of the JavaScript you've learned up to this point was in ES5 (ECMAScript 5), which was finalized in 2009. While you can still write programs in ES5, JavaScript is constantly evolving, and new features are released every year.\\n \\nES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language. In this course, you'll learn these new features, including arrow functions, destructuring, classes, promises, and modules.\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n   \\n      \\n      Previous Lesson  \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",

HTML\\n00:03:20 Currently relying on DOM mutations\\n00:04:00 Updating DOM based on state\\n00:04:50 Initial approach was manual changes\\n00:05:40 Backbone.js focus on the MVC approach\\n00:08:00 Angular.js focus on two-way binding\\n00:09:30 React.js focus on FP unidirection\\n00:10:30 React treats view as function output\\n00:11:20 Example of \"encapsulation\" in React\\n00:12:00 Example of \"polymorphism\" in React\\n00:12:30 Popularity of React at the moment\\n00:13:00 Example of declarative UI with \"render\"\\n00:13:30 Basic declarative UI with \".innerHTML\"\\n00:14:15 Replace the entire view with each change\\n00:15:10 Changing example to declarative\\n00:16:30 Passing the entire store as a param\\n00:17:10 \".map\" higher-order function\\n00:18:40 Replace all HTML in the example\\n00:19:30 Basic declarative UI principles\\n00:20:30 Up until now have done imperative UI\\n00:21:10 Very basic declarative UI\\n00:22:20 Declarative HTML bad performance\\n00:23:00 Directly mutating the DOM is faster\\n00:23:30 However, mutations are harder  to debug\\n00:24:10 Problem with event listeners\\n00:24:50 Problem with losing focus on render\\n00:27:30 Frameworks abstract away mutations\\n00:28:10 Declarative UI without drawbacks\\n00:29:10 Express HTML as a result of a function\\n00:29:40 Frameworks abstract away the DOM\\n00:30:10 Understanding what gets abstracted\\n00:30:40 Higher-order functions (HOF)\\n00:31:10 HOF tend to be more declarative\\n00:33:10 HOF keep data unidirectional\\n00:34:10 I will focus on frameworks soon\\n00:34:50 Frameworks'

create abstractions\\n00:06:50 What is \"Procedural Programming\"?\\n00:08:00 What is a \"GOTO\" statement?\\n00:09:00 Procedures hide \"GOTO\" logic\\n00:09:30 Encourages nesting functions as an abstraction\\n00:10:30 What is \"Object Oriented Programming\" (OOP)?\\n00:11:30 OOP used to be the primary paradigm for a long time\\n00:12:00 However, OOP struggles with concurrency\\n00:13:00 Functions as constructors for objects\\n00:13:50 All paradigms remove some functionality\\n00:14:40 OOP doesn't treat behaviour as instructions\\n00:15:20 OOP abstracts code according to \"things\"\\n00:15:50 All behaviour is handled through \"interfaces\"\\n00:16:30 Can not directly access inside from outside\\n00:17:10 What is \"Functional Programming\" (FP)?\\n00:17:40 FP is based on mathematic principles\\n00:18:10 OOP combines data and behaviour\\n00:19:20 FP keeps data and behaviour separate\\n00:19:50 OOP and FP remove different functionality\\n00:20:30 FP says the problem is data changing\\n00:21:30 The web is getting more decentralised\\n00:22:20 FP mitigates race-conditions\\n00:23:10 OOP makes it hard to split up behaviour\\n00:23:50 Type of problem depends on what you are building\\n00:25:10 JavaScript is becoming more FP-like\\n00:26:00 You always need to do both OOP and FP\\n00:26:50 FP says abstractions should avoid changing\\n00:28:40 In FP, behaviour is always predictable\\n00:29:00 Abstractions are immutable in FP\\n00:29:40 Recapping paradigms\\n00:30:00 Example of OOP approach\\n00:30:50 Example of FP approach\\n \\n \\n Further reading To further

Furthermore, it also consists of several non-physical graphics shown on the screen from your cursor, buttons, taskbars and text inputs.\\n \\nAll this complexity is grouped under the simple concept known as a “computer”, which can have several properties.\\n\\nSwitched on or off\\nProcessing, idle or even frozen\\nFast or slow\\n\\n \\nWe haven’t even considered more permanent properties like, whether it is a cheap, expensive laptop, desktop, PC, Mac, gaming or work computer.\\n \\nThere are also some things you can do with a computer:\\n\\nBrowse the internet\\nWrite an essay\\nShop on Takealot\\nInstall a game\\nDesign and print a flyer\\nCoding\\n\\n \\nNot only do our brains automatically take a group of related low-level complex parts and group them into simpler “things”,. You might even be curious how your brain instinctively “knows” what something is without having to inspect every element it is made from in detail until you can conclude, “I think this is maybe a door”.\\n \\nA well-known American Psychologist, Oliver Sacks, wrote a book comically titled The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1985) that tells a real-life story of a condition called visual agnosia in which a man lost his ability to reason about “objects” in a manner that doesn’t require considering every single part that makes up the whole. In the story, after leaving therapy, there is a brief moment when the man instinctively cannot tell the difference between his wife and his hat without carefully considering each in great detail.\\n \\nThis ability to instinctively think and talk about “objects”, whether in programming or real life, is a process of what is called “abstraction”. Abstraction is our ability to simplify entities to a core set of properties and interactions without understanding the whole.\\n \\nFurthermore, you can identify general parts that make up these items.\\n\\nScreen\\nKeyboard\\nMouse or Touchpad\\n\\n \\nEach of these might further be broken down into sub-items; for example, a keyboard might consist of the following:\\n\\nEnter Key\\nEscape Key\\nArrow Keys\\nSpacebar\\n\\n \\nFurthermore, each of these keys has parts that can be further reasoned about until we get down to the physical atoms that make up the physical material these are made of (and even beyond that into the realm of quantum physics).\\n \\nHowever, despite the reservations you might have about the “simplicity” of the above, it repeatedly comes up time and time again as the essential part of modern-day software development. Furthermore, often the ability to meaningfully abstract code is what separates bad software developers from good software developers.\\n \\nUnfortunately, most developers often only learn this later on in their careers. In his seminal book, titled “Composing Software (2018)”, Eric Elliot remarks that:\\n \\nOne of my biggest regrets in life is that I failed to understand the significance of that lesson early on. I learned the essence of software design far too late in life. I have interviewed hundreds of developers. What I’ve learned from those sessions is that I’m not alone. […] If you’re a software developer, you compose functions and data structures every day, whether you know it or not. You can do it consciously (and better), or you can do it accidentally, with duct-tape and crazy glue. The process of software development is breaking down large problems into smaller problems, building components that solve those smaller problems, then composing those components together to form a complete application.\\n \\n \\n Further reading Please work through the following resources to further enhance your understanding of the concepts discussed in this module.\\n \\n          - Medium.com: Abstraction & Composition\\n          - Watch: The Art of Abstraction - Computerphile by Computerphile\\n          - Watch: What is abstraction in programming? by IAmDev Grant\\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n      \\n      Previous Lesson  \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",

how JavaScript should be structured when it forms part of a larger piece of software. So that you know, there is no reading material. Instead, you are required to watch two videos. So please pay attention and think through these ideas in detail since all lessons from this point onwards will constantly revisit these concepts.\\n \\nYou don't need to do a technical challenge. Instead, you will have to talk with your coach about the concepts covered in the videos to confirm that you understand how to structure your JavaScript code.\\n \\nCore Concepts Part 1\\n\\n \\n00:00:00 Introduction\\n00:00:40 Reflecting on JavaScript Fundamentals\\n00:02:00 Getting from fundamentals to full-on software\\n00:02:30 Scale complexity incrementally by using composition\\n00:04:00 Importance of mid-level code structures\\n00:05:00 Comparing JavaScript to rocket science\\n00:08:00 Thinking about software as workable material\\n00:08:00 Software often fails catastrophically\\n00:09:00 Programming requires patience regardless of skill\\n00:10:30 First ever recorded computer bug in history\\n00:11:30 It is impossible to create bug-free code\\n00:12:30 Mid-level bugs are much harder to find and fix\\n00:13:30 Getting code to work is the easy part\\n00:14:30 Keep the focus on what is really hard in programming\\n00:15:30 We can only equip you to walk this journey\\n00:16:00 Talking about your career path\\n00:16:30 Fundamentals is not enough\\n00:17:20 Strive towards thinking about architecture\\n00:18:00 Understand both fundamentals and architecture\\n00:19:30 Building a programming career takes a long time\\n00:20:10 Programming is complex, scary and frustrating\\n00:21:40 Extreme focus on precision and accuracy\\n00:23:20 Overwhelming amount of moving parts and people\\n00:24:10 Should write that is readable by other people\\n00:24:50 Software has an extremely long lifecycle\\n00:26:45 Introducing four stories to illustrate concepts\\n00:27:10 First example: Ariane 5 Rocket Incident\\n00:28:20 Very rare for codebases to be rewritten entirely\\n00:29:00 Problem was caused by automatic coercion of a value\\n00:30:00 What Ariane 5 code might have looked like\\n00:31:20 Hidden bugs more dangerous than obvious bugs\\n00:32:20 Second example: Mars Climate Orbiter\\n00:34:00 Problem was an incorrect assumption about the code\\n00:34:40 What code might have looked like\\n00:35:00 Real-world use of AI in day-to-day coding\\n00:36:30 Third example: Knight Capital Incident\\n00:38:40 Fourth example: Facebook DNS Incident\\n00:40:20 Not obvious how complex maintaining software is\\n00:41:00 It is impossible to build fail-proof software\\n00:42:00 Even when less severe, there are still implications\\n00:43:00 Mentioning the \"Eloquent JavaScript\" book\\n00:44:00 Getting confused by your own code\\n00:45:00 Complexity is the most critical problem in coding\\n \\n    \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",

built-in prototypal chaining on which JavaScript classes are built. We will specifically look at how prototypes are used in the JavaScript DOM and utilise this functionality to extend the HTML. This gives us the means to create custom, fully-encapsulated HTML elements.\\n \\nIn the first lecture, we will look at how to use classes and the concept of inheritance to create objects with defined structure and behaviour quickly.\\n \\n\\n \\n00:00:00 Introduction\\n00:00:50 Example of \"encapsulation\" benefit\\n00:02:00 Re-adding error event listener\\n00:03:00 What are JavaScript \"class\" keywords?\\n00:03:50 What is \"syntactic sugar\"?\\n00:04:30 Creating an example of a JavaScript class\\n00:06:00 Using \"new\" with JS Classes\\n00:06:30 Classes require the usage of \"this\"\\n00:07:00 Hiding class properties with \"#\"\\n00:07:30 \"constructor\" method in JS Classes\\n00:08:20 How to use JSDoc with JS Classes\\n00:10:00 Historically, \"classes\" in OOP are the interface\\n00:10:30 Can still wrap JS class in the factory function\\n00:11:20 Setting \"@param\" on the constructor method\\n00:11:50 Unless made private, it is public by default\\n00:12:10 Examples of built-in JS Classes\\n00:12:40 Some classes do not have constructors\\n00:13:10 Example of \"static\" properties in classes\\n00:14:00 \"setters\" and \"getters\" in JS Classes\\n00:14:30 \"setters\" and \"getters\" need a unique name\\n00:15:00 Classes are generally harder to split up\\n00:15:30 Misconception that inheritance is the core of OOP\\n00:16:00 \"Favour composition over inheritance\"\\n00:16:30 Avoid inheritance as far as you can\\n00:17:00 How does inheritance work?\\n00:17:30 Using \"extends\" with JS classes\\n00:18:00 Example of the inheritance hierarchy\\n00:19:30 Example of how properties are inherited\\n00:20:00 Inheritance creates extremely tight coupling\\n00:20:30 Example accidentally overriding behaviour\\n00:21:30 Inheritance hides too many things\\n00:22:00 \"Mixins\" as an alternative to inheritance\\n00:23:00 Focus on \"has\" or \"can\" instead of \"is\"\\n00:24:00 Side note about lexical scope in methods\\n00:24:30 Example of \"mixin\"-based composition\\n00:25:20 Composition more flexible than inheritance\\n00:25:50 Problem of \"inheritance\" in real-world\\n00:26:40 Unable to always avoid inheritance\\n00:27:10 Consistency is always the most important\\n00:27:50 JavaScript DOM is frustrating to work with\\n00:28:30 Classes and factory functions closer than think\\n00:29:00 JS classes are not the same as other language classes\\n00:29:30 What are JavaScript \"prototypes\"?\\n00:30:20 Example of DOM \"prototypal chain\"\\n00:31:20 Everything in JavaScript is based on \"Object\"\\n00:31:40 Prototypal chain in MDN documentation\\n00:32:20 JavaScript classes can only extend one prototype\\n00:33:10 JavaScript does not have \"implements\"\\n00:33:50 JavaScript does not have \"abstract\"\\n00:34:30 What happens under the hood of JS class?\\n00:35:30 JS class use function prototype\\n00:36:00 We assigned manually before JS Classes\\n00:36:40 \"Prototypes\" do not actually \"inherit\"\\n00:37:20 \"Prototypes\" are merely fallbacks\\n00:37:50 Can introduce bugs that are hard to find\\n00:38:20 Example of prototypes in DOM\\n00:39:20 JS prototypes are dangerous\\n00:41:00 Fallbacks can update after the instance is created\\n00:42:20 In the early days of JS, this was abused\\n00:42:50 Today this is considered bad practice\\n00:43:20 Example of why it is dangerous\\n00:45:00 Has too much hidden behaviour\\n00:45:30 Why might seem useful at first\\n00:46:20 Early JS libraries extended prototypes\\n00:47:00 Eventually realised extending prototypes is bad\\n00:48:30 Prototypes still hidden under classes\\n00:50:30 Classes syntax does not expose prototypes directly\\n00:51:00 Yet JS Classes are not true classes\\n00:51:30 JS Classes closer to factory functions\\n00:51:00 Web Components require DOM prototypes\\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",

restricting ourselves to immutability, pure functions and separation of data from behaviour, we can write code more declaratively. This helps us focus on the \"what\" rather than the \"how”, which significantly reduces complexity, increases readability and makes our code easier to debug.\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n00:00:00 Introduction\\n00:00:30 Need both FP and OOP\\n00:01:30 Abstracting UI components\\n00:02:40 Creating class inside closure\\n00:03:10 Check if there is a hyphen in the element name\\n00:03:40 Register element inside closure\\n00:04:10 Shadow DOM in abstraction\\n00:04:40 HTML template in abstraction\\n00:05:10 Event listeners in abstraction\\n00:05:50 Store subscription in abstraction\\n00:06:40 Creating a JavaScript Framework\\n00:07:30 Good exercise in re-creating tools\\n00:08:30 Framework's most important abstraction\\n00:09:30 Be careful when using AI tools\\n00:10:40 Adding listeners in \"connectedCallback\"\\n00:11:20 Removing \"disconnectedCallback\"\\n00:12:20 Remove even if not needed\\n00:13:30 \"Containers\" vs \"Components\" pattern\\n00:14:40 Working example of our framework\\n00:15:50 Adding interactivity to our example\\n00:17:00 Add means to get HTML elements\\n00:18:50 Passing \"getHTML\" into callbacks\\n00:19:30 Wrapper around the event handler\\n00:21:00 NodeList coercion helper function\\n00:21:40 Array to remove event listeners\\n00:22:20 Relax if you do not understand at all\\n00:23:30 Handling form submission\\n00:24:00 Overriding ts-check for a few lines\\n00:24:50 Convert form response to an object\\n00:25:20 Type-checking requires more work\\n00:26:30 Add submission to the \"store\"\\n00:27:10 Structured approach takes longer\\n00:28:00 Dispatch action to \"store\"\\n00:28:30 Update HTML imperatively\\n00:29:20 Find tasks created in the change\\n00:29:50 Check which is not in the previous state\\n00:30:10 Check which is not in the next state\\n00:32:30 Is there a better way?\\n00:33:00 Understand the problem first\\n00:34:30 Learn mechanics under abstractions\\n00:34:00 Using abstractions without knowing\\n00:34:30 \"The Law of Leaky Abstractions\"\\n00:35:20 Low-level TCP mechanics with metaphor\\n00:36:00 Explain the TCP abstraction itself\\n00:37:30 Abstractions aim to hide details\\n00:38:10 All abstractions sometimes \"leak\"\\n00:39:00 Example of ASP.NET as a leaky abstraction\\n00:39:30 Learn mechanisms under abstractions\\n00:40:40 Reason #1: Required to debug\\n00:43:50 Reason #2: Discuss your code\\n00:45:00 Reason #3: Compare abstractions\\n00:46:20 Reason #4: Learn from incorrect choices\\n00:47:10 All abstractions have trade-offs\\n00:49:00 Understand mechanics to use abstraction better\\n00:49:30 Better abstractions make learning harder\\n00:50:30 A lot of developers are stuck in junior positions\\n00:52:00 Find similar opinions and keep this in mind\\n00:53:00 Next video declarative DOM abstractions\\n \\n \\n    \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",

corresponding data).\\n \\nconst provinces = ['Western Cape', 'Gauteng', 'Northern Cape', 'Eastern Cape', 'KwaZulu-Natal', 'Free State']\\nconst names = ['Ashwin', 'Sibongile', 'Jan-Hendrik', 'Sifso', 'Shailen', 'Frikkie']\\n \\n\\nUse forEach to console log each name to the console. You are allowed to call console.log seven times.\\nUse forEach to console log each name with a matching province (for example Ashwin (Western Cape). Note that you are only allowed to call console.log seven times.\\nUsing map loop over all province names and turn the string to all uppercase. Log the new array to the console.\\nCreate a new array with map that has the amount of characters in each name. The result should be: [6, 9, 11, 5, 7, 7]\\nUsing toSorted to sort all provinces alphabetically.\\nUse filter to remove all provinces that have the word Cape in them. After filtering the array, return the amount of provinces left. The final value should be 3\\nCreate a boolean array by using map and some to determine whether a name contains an S character. The result should be [true, true, false, true, true, false]\\nUsing only reduce, turn the above into an object that indicates the province of an individual. In other words:\\n\\n \\n{\\n  Ashwin: 'Western Cape',\\n\\tSibongile: 'Gauteng',\\n  'Jan-Hendrik': 'Northern Cape',\\n\\tSifso: 'Eastern Cape',\\n\\tShailen: 'KwaZulu-Natal',\\n\\tFrikkie: 'Free State',\\n\\n \\nBelow are additional exercises. However note that in all the following exercises all code should be written inside the brackets of a single console.log , with the final result being logged to the console. This means that your code will probably look something as follows:\\n \\nconsole.log(\\n  // Your code here\\n)\\n \\nSee the data and exercises below. As per the above, you will be required to do the following and explain the why and how to your coach in your assessment.\\n \\nconst products = [\\n  { product: 'banana', price: \"2\" },\\n  { product: 'mango', price: 6 },\\n  { product: 'potato', price: ' ' },\\n  { product: 'avocado', price: \"8\" },\\n  { product: 'coffee', price: 10 },\\n  { product: 'tea', price: '' },\\n]\\n \\n\\nUse forEach to console.log each product name to the console.\\nUse filter to filter out products that have a name longer than 5 characters\\nUsing both filter and map. Convert all prices that are strings to numbers, and remove all products from the array that do not have prices. After this has been done then use reduce to calculate the combined price of all remaining products.\\nUse reduce to concatenate all product names to create the following string: banana, mango, potato, avocado, coffee and tea.\\nUse reduce to calculate both the highest and lowest-priced items. The names should be returned as the following string: Highest: coffee. Lowest: banana.\\nUsing only Object.entries and reduce recreate the object with the exact same values. However, the following object keys should be changed in the new array:\\n\\t\\nproduct should be changed to name\\nprice should be changed to cost\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nIn your 1-on-1 session with your coach, you will be required to demonstrate your understanding of all concepts covered in this module. Please Note: It is your understanding of the HOW and WHY that your coach will be trying to establish.  It is at the discretion of the coach to determine what they will ask you, and how deeply they require you to understand specific concepts.\\n \\n \\n   \\n      \\n      Previous Lesson  \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",

However, in this module, we will explore how proper throwing and handling errors in software results in much more maintainable software. We will look at several examples where proper usage of errors could have prevented bad outcomes.\\n \\nCore Concepts: Part 1\\n \\n\\n \\n00:00:00 Introduction\\n00:00:30 Understanding errors are critical\\n00:01:00 Errors are tools to help manage complexity\\n00:01:50 First actual bug recorded in computer history\\n00:02:30 Computers were more mechanical than electrical\\n00:03:20 Word \"bug\" is still in use today\\n00:03:50 Bug vs Error\\n00:04:20 Bugs are unplanned effects in software\\n00:05:00 Similar to side-effects in medication\\n00:05:30 Bugs can be bad or good\\n00:08:00 Some bad bugs do not stop operation\\n00:08:30 Introducing the concept of \"unsafe state\"\\n00:09:20 Compile-time vs runtime bugs\\n00:10:00 Failing early and loudly\\n00:10:30 Software crashing might be the best option\\n00:11:00 Example of a bug in \"FaceTime\" app\\n00:11:30 Mention of \"defensive programming\"\\n00:12:40 Introducing Therac-25 incident\\n00:13:10 Overview of what Therac-25 itself\\n00:13:40 Mention of open-closed principle\\n00:14:10 Upgrading is risky if complexity not controlled\\n00:14:30 Summarising context of Therac-25\\n00:15:00 Different configurations in Therac-25\\n00:15:30 What interfaces might have looked like\\n00:16:00 Industry learned much from this incident\\n00:16:30 Overview of \"Malfunction 54\"\\n00:17:00 Popular underappreciation of complexity\\n00:17:50 Dangerous if you remove an error without understanding\\n00:19:10 Race-condition bugs are tough to detect\\n00:19:40 Common case study in computer science\\n \\n \\n    \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",

      [DWA_10.3 Challenge 1  In this module, you will be required to use the Shoelace component library in a brand-new JavaScript project and build the original Tally App example from the very first lesson using only Shoelace components. You will be provided with three user stories that should be met at a minimum, however, you are encouraged to add additional functionality. You are free to choose the components you think are best suited to meet these user stories. Be mindful to examine all components and read the documentation thoroughly before proceeding.\\n \\nYou are required to resolve the following User Stories (expressed in Gherkin syntax).\\n \\n\\nSCENARIO: Increment the counter by one\\n\\nGIVEN the tally counter app is open\\nAND the counter is at 0\\nWHEN I click the \"Add\" button\\nTHEN the counter should display 1\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSCENARIO: Decrement the counter by one\\n\\nGIVEN the tally counter app is open\\nAND the counter is at 1\\nWHEN I click the \"Subtract\" button\\nTHEN the counter should display 0\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSCENARIO: Resetting the Tally Counter\\n\\nGIVEN the tally counter app is open\\nAND the counter value is 10\\nWHEN I click on the \"Reset\" button\\nTHEN the counter value should change to 0\\nAND a confirmation message should be displayed that the counter has been reset\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\nIn your 1-on-1 session with your coach, you will be required to demonstrate your understanding of all concepts covered in this module. It is at the discretion of the coach to determine what they will ask you, and how deeply they require you to understand specific concepts.\\n \\n   \\n      \\n      Previous Lesson  \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",

[DWA_02.7 JavaScript at War  The critical implication is that this period was the exception, not the rule. Alternatively, it can be framed as a bug and not a feature of the JavaScript specification process.\\n \\nFrom its inception, the language was intended to be in constant development and flux as it tries to catch up to published specifications. As a result, the first three versions of the specification were released with about one year between them. This tradition is continued today, so you might have seen an understanding of the specification being referred to by the year it was published (for example, ES6 as ES2015, ES7 as ES2016, and so forth). However, the distinction between the specification and the actual JavaScript you can use at any time is essential.\\n \\nOne of my favourite American Beat-era poets, William S. Burroughs, remarked that:\\n \\nThis is a war universe. War all the time. That is its nature. There may be other universes based on all sorts of other principles, but ours seems to be based on war and games.\\n— William S. Burroughs, Grand Street 37 (1991)\\n \\nIn the same way, JavaScript itself is a language caught in endless war and games between the platonic, idealistic specification created by the TC39 and the actual piecemeal implementation by these different compilers. Furthermore, in some cases, teams either flatly decline to implement aspects of the specification. For example, Mozilla, responsible for the Spider Monkey compiler, wrote a public letter in 2015 on why they refuse to implement some aspects of the latest specification - specifically citing grievances with the team behind the V8 compiler.\\n \\nThis tension between the writers of specifications and the individuals behind compilers (called vendors) is most clearly illustrated by a warning in the W3C Web App Manifest specification that reads as follows:\\n \\nImplementors who are not taking part in the discussions will find the specification changing out from under them in incompatible ways. Vendors interested in implementing this specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation phase should subscribe to the repository on GitHub and take part in the discussions.\\n— W3C, Web App Manifest (2020)\\n \\nThis means there is a never-ending tug-of-war between the specification and what is supported in specific environments and between the specification and particular implementations.\\n \\nTo quote one of the god-fathers of the modern web, Eric Meyer:\\n \\n“The Web is the most hostile environment to developer assumptions imaginable.”\\n \\nTherefore, we must have a good understanding of the landscape, to not get lost along the way.\\n \\n \\n Further reading PLEASE WORK THROUGH THE FOLLOWING REQUIRED RESOURCES FOR THIS MODULE.\\n \\n          - Caniuse and MDN compatibility data collaboration\\n          - What’s the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript?\\n          - TC39 and its contributions to ECMAScript\\n          - A Brief History of JavaScript\\n \\n \\n  \\n      \\n      Previous Lesson  \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",

the “Book Connect” project and consider them through the lens of SOLID.\\n \\nTake a moment to rate all your abstractions in terms of the best three and the worst three. Attempt to apply SOLID principles to the worst three as means to improve them.\\n \\nYou will have a call with your coach where you highlight the following:\\n\\nWhich were the three best abstractions, and why?\\nWhich were the three worst abstractions, and why?\\nHow can the three worst abstractions be improved via SOLID principles?\\n\\n \\nIn your 1-on-1 session with your coach, you will be required to demonstrate your understanding of all concepts covered in this module. It is at the discretion of the coach to determine what they will ask you, and how deeply they require you to understand specific concepts\\n   \\n      \\n      Previous Lesson  \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",

your abstractions.\\n \\nPreviously, you worked on adding abstraction around the book preview functionality of the project. Next, you must turn the book preview abstraction into a fully-working web component. Then, apply the techniques you’ve learned about this module to the book preview.\\n \\nIf you are up for it, you can also convert other aspects of the app into web components.\\n \\nYou will have a call with your coach where you highlight the following:\\n\\nWhat problems did you encounter converting the book preview to a component?\\nWhat other elements make sense to convert into web components? Why?\\nWhy does keeping your HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a single file sometimes make sense?\\n\\n \\nIn your 1-on-1 session with your coach, you will be required to demonstrate your understanding of all concepts covered in this module. It is at the discretion of the coach to determine what they will ask you, and how deeply they require you to understand specific concepts.\\n \\n \\n   \\n      \\n      Previous Lesson  \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",

your own implementation of a Redux-inspired store to manage the state of a basic counting Tally App. Note that you are not required to render any HTML to the screen, but instead should add subscriptions that merely log the new state to the console if it changes.\\n \\nPlease look at the video below, for a quick overview of the challenge.\\n \\n\\n \\nSee below user stories (in Gherkin syntax):\\n \\n\\n\\nSCENARIO: Increment the counter by one\\n\\nGIVEN no interactions have been performed yet\\nWHEN the “getState” method is run\\nAND the result is logged to the console\\nAND the browser console is open\\nTHEN the state should show a count of 0\\n\\n\\n\\nSCENARIO: Increment the counter by one\\n\\nGIVEN no interactions have been performed yet\\nWHEN an “ADD” action is dispatched\\nAND another “ADD” action is dispatched\\nAND the browser console is open\\nTHEN the state should show a count of 2\\n\\n\\n\\nSCENARIO: Increment the counter by one\\n\\nGIVEN the current count in the state is 2\\nWHEN a “SUBTRACT” action is dispatched\\nAND the browser console is open\\nTHEN the state should display a count of 1\\n\\n\\n\\nSCENARIO: Resetting the Tally Counter\\n\\nGIVEN the current count in the state is 1\\nWHEN a “RESET” action is dispatched\\nAND the browser console is open\\nTHEN the state should display a count of 0\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nIn your 1-on-1 session with your coach, you will be required to demonstrate your understanding of all concepts covered in this module. It is at the discretion of the coach to determine what they will ask you, and how deeply they require you to understand specific concepts.\\n \\n \\n   \\n      \\n      Previous Lesson  \\n      \\n      Next Lesson]  \n",
